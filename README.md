# Tensorflow

The first two jupyter notebooks are provided by Tensorflow. 

## SoftMax Regression.ipynb
I utilized The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) to learn how to Softmax Regression as part of the Tensorflow package. The MNIST database consists of handwritten digits. Softmax Regression allows for multi-class classification.  

## Tensorflow Example.ipynb

I used GradientDescentOptimizer to learn how to use Tensorflow.
